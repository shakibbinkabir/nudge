# Nudge

**Your intelligent and sassy sidekick against procrastination.** Nudge is a productivity-focused Chrome extension that transforms your new tab page into a smart, beautiful, and focused workspace designed to keep you on track.

-----

> ‚ú® **Note:** This project is currently in active development for the v1.0 launch. The latest pre-release is **v0.7.0**. It is stable and feature-complete. Your feedback is highly appreciated\!

## About The Project

Do you ever open a new tab with the intent to be productive, only to find yourself mindlessly drifting to social media or YouTube? Nudge was built to solve this exact problem.

It replaces your default new tab with a dashboard that surfaces your most important tasks. More importantly, it acts as a gentle guardian, intercepting visits to distracting websites and "nudging" you back towards your goals. It's not a harsh blocker; it's a flexible companion that helps you build better Browse habits.

## Key Features

  * ‚ú® **Dynamic & Inspiring New Tab Page**: A beautiful, auto-refreshing background image with a readability overlay.
  * ‚úÖ **Intelligent Task Prioritization**: A to-do list that automatically sorts tasks by completion status, priority level, and deadline.
  * üß† **Smart Task Input**: The "Add Task" field can intelligently detect dates and priorities from natural language (e.g., "Finish report by Friday high priority").
  * üö´ **Advanced Distraction Management**: A completely redesigned system to manage your blacklist with Block/Unblock toggles, favicons for easy identification, and a real-time favicon preview.
  * üßò **Fully Animated Intervention UI**: A beautiful "frosted glass" intervention page that animates in sequence to gently guide you back to focus.
  * ‚öôÔ∏è **State-Aware Settings Dashboard**: A professional, "Tech Dashboard" style settings page that dynamically adapts to your configuration.
  * üîê **Dual API Key System**: Choose between an easy email/OTP setup using the Nudge API or bring your own Pexels key for unlimited, private access.

## How It Works

Nudge operates on two core principles:

1.  **Reinforce Focus**: By replacing the new tab with your prioritized tasks, it constantly reminds you of your goals, making it easier to stay on track.
2.  **Interrupt Distraction**: By redirecting you from a blacklisted site to the new animated intervention page, it breaks the mindless habit loop and forces a moment of conscious choice.

### The Nudge API (`lab.shakibbinkabir.me`)

To provide background images without requiring every user to sign up for a developer account, Nudge uses a proxy API.

  * **How it works**: When you use the "Free API Key" option, the extension communicates with this secure backend, which fetches an image from Pexels and sends it back to you.
  * **Rate Limiting**: This service is rate-limited to **16 background image requests per month** per user.

## Installation (Latest Pre-Release: v0.7.0)

1.  Download the `nudge-v0.7.0-pre-release.zip` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/shakibbinkabir/nudge/releases) page.
2.  Unzip the downloaded file.
3.  Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
4.  Enable **"Developer mode"** using the toggle in the top-right corner.
5.  Click **"Load unpacked"**.
6.  Select the unzipped `nudge-extension` folder. The Nudge icon should appear.

-----

## Configuration & Setup

After installation, open the settings page by clicking the Nudge icon in your extensions bar or the gear icon on the new tab page.

#### Option 1: Use the Nudge API (Easy Setup)

1.  On the settings page, in the "API Keys" section, enter your email and click "Get Verification Code."
2.  Check your email for a 6-digit OTP.
3.  Enter the OTP and click "Verify & Save Key."

#### Option 2: Use Your Own Pexels Key (BYOK)

1.  Go to [Pexels.com/api/](https://www.pexels.com/api/) to get your free personal API key.
2.  On the settings page, toggle to the "Use Your Own Pexels Key" option.
3.  Paste your key into the input field and click "Save Pexels Key." The extension will validate it before saving.
4.  This method gives you a much higher personal limit (20,000 requests/month) and does not use the Nudge API service.

## About the Developer

Hey there, I'm Shakib.

I'm a 20-year-old developer from Bangladesh, running on coffee and about a dozen parallel thought processes, thanks to ADHD. My brain is like a browser with 100 tabs open‚Äîall of them playing different music. The "one quick YouTube video" often turns into a two-hour deep dive into anything but the code I'm supposed to be writing.

Standard to-do lists felt like a parent nagging me. I didn't need another list; I needed a *sidekick*. Something that would show up at the exact moment of weakness‚Äîwhen that new tab opens‚Äîand sassily ask, "Are you *sure* you want to do that?"

So, I built **Nudge**. It‚Äôs less of a tool and more of a digital guardian for chaotic minds like mine.

Nudge is the first major experiment from my digital workshop, the **[Lab by Shakib Bin Kabir](https://lab.shakibbinkabir.me)** (still under construction\!), where I build solutions for the problems I face every day. It's open-source because I know I'm not the only one fighting this battle. If this sounds like you, check out my other projects or contribute on **[GitHub](https://github.com/shakibbinkabir)**.

Want to see what else I'm up to? You can find more on my **[personal site](https://shakibbinkabir.me)**.

Got ideas, questions, or just want to chat about building tools for beautifully chaotic brains? Drop me a line at **[contact@shakibbinkabir.me](mailto:contact@shakibbinkabir.me)**.
