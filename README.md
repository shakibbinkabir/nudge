## About The Project

Do you ever open a new tab with the intent to be productive, only to find yourself mindlessly drifting to social media or YouTube? Nudge was built to solve this exact problem.

It replaces your default new tab with a dashboard that surfaces your most important tasks. More importantly, it acts as a gentle guardian, intercepting visits to distracting websites and "nudging" you back towards your goals. It's not a harsh blocker; it's a flexible companion that helps you build better Browse habits.

## How It Works

Nudge operates on two core principles:

1.  **Reinforce Focus:** By replacing the new tab with your prioritized tasks, it constantly reminds you of your goals, making it easier to stay on track.
2.  **Interrupt Distraction:** By redirecting you from a blacklisted site to an animated intervention page, it breaks the mindless habit loop and forces a moment of conscious choice.

### The Nudge API (`lab.shakibbinkabir.me`)


To provide beautiful background images without requiring every user to sign up for a developer account, Nudge uses a proxy API.

Note: Temporarily unavailable. The steps below guide you to use your own Pexels key.

-   **How it works (when enabled):** When you use the "Free API Key" option, the extension communicates with this secure backend, which fetches an image from Pexels and sends it back to you.
-   **Rate Limiting:** The service is rate-limited to **64 background image requests per month** per user.

## About the Developer

Hey there, I'm Shakib.

I'm a 20-year-old developer from Bangladesh, running on coffee and about a dozen parallel thought processes, thanks to ADHD. My brain is like a browser with 100 tabs open‚Äîall of them playing different music. The "one quick YouTube video" often turns into a two-hour deep dive into anything but the code I'm supposed to be writing.

Standard to-do lists felt like a parent nagging me. I didn't need another list; I needed a *sidekick*. Something that would show up at the exact moment of weakness‚Äîwhen that new tab opens‚Äîand sassily ask, "Are you *sure* you want to do that?"

So, I built **Nudge**. It‚Äôs less of a tool and more of a digital guardian for chaotic minds like mine.

Nudge is the first major experiment from my digital workshop, the **[Lab by Shakib Bin Kabir](https://lab.shakibbinkabir.me)** (still under construction!), where I build solutions for the problems I face every day. It's open-source because I know I'm not the only one fighting this battle. If this sounds like you, check out my other projects or contribute on **[GitHub](https://github.com/shakibbinkabir)**.

Want to see what else I'm up to? You can find more on my **[personal site](https://shakibbinkabir.me)**.

Got ideas, questions, or just want to chat about building tools for beautifully chaotic brains? Drop me a line at **[contact@shakibbinkabir.me](mailto:contact@shakibbinkabir.me)**.
